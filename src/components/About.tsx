        Hi, I'm Fakhrul, an aspiring web developer based in Selangor, Malaysia.
        As an Information Technology undergraduate, I'm passionate about
        building modern web applications using React and Express, with TypeScript ofc! I'm currently
        expanding my skillset by exploring Laravel to broaden my full-stack
        development capabilities.
